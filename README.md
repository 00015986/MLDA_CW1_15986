## Student Dropout / Academic Success Prediction
Python: 3.11.10
Conda: 24.11.3
</b>

### Project Description
This project predicts a student's academic outcome using machine learning.
The user can enter specific feature values, and the model will predict whether the student is likely to:

Drop out
Stay Enrolled
Graduate Successfully

Two ML models were created:

Random Forest requires 18 input features
K-Nearest Neighbors KNN requires 36 input features 

The final accuracy ranges between 70% and 85% depending on the model.
The app also shows the probability distribution for each class to help understand model confidence.
